<b>Oztea 1941</b><br>
<br>
<br><em>Great Britain stands alone, struggling to hold together its Empire, beset by the European Axis. Victories for the Allies have been far and few between. France has surrendered to Germany and Italy, the Greek campaign has ended in failure, the Royal Air Force has suffered heavy losses as British cities are bombed daily, and the gains made in North Africa are in jeporady as German reinforcements arrive. Yet worse still, the German Battleship Bismark and a myraid of U-Boats are marauding the North Atlantic and threatening to starve the United Kingdom of supplies and into submission. But a whole new war is on the horizon as Operation Barbarossa is set to begin in earnest, German forces are poised to cut deep into the Soviet Union. And in the east, the Japanese Empire is poised to launch a series of surprise attacks on the colonies of the West and the forces of the United States, plunging the world into a truly global war. The year is 1941, battles have been fought, but the war has just begun.</em><br>
<br>

<b>Note</b><br>
This is Ozteas 1941 set up for the Global 1940 game. Politically the game begins as if it was the the third turn. Germany is at war with France, UK, and ANZAC. Italy is at war with France, UK, and ANZAC. Japan is at war with China and France.<br>
<br>

<b>Special Rules:</b><br>
Soviet Naval units in the Pacific Theatre must remain adjacent to original Soviet territory while the Soviet Union is neutral to Japan.<br>
The Japanese Kamikaze special rule is deactivated when using the 1941 set up (It has been left active. It can be turned off in Game Options.).<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>**REVISIONS**</b><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Revised Air Raid Rules:</b> Fighters attack and defend at 2. Strategic and tactical bombers attack at 1.<br><br>

<b>Revised Capital Capture Rules:</b> The capture of a player's capital results in the plunder of that player's PUs only the <b>first</b> time the capital is taken. Subsequent recapture of the same capital results in the player's PUs being destroyed.<br><br>

<b>Revised Victory Conditions:</b> If Germany is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in the Pacific requires 7 (rather than 6) Pacific VCs. If Japan is Allied controlled, an Axis victory in Europe requires 9 (rather than 8) Europe VCs. 

<br><br>
<b>Revised Bomber Cost:</b> Strategic bombers now cost 14 PUs, rather than 12. <br><br>

<b>New Unit - Marines:</b> Cost 5; Attack at 1 (2 during amphibious assaults); Defend at 2; No bonus from artillery; Can be loaded onto cruisers and battleships (1 to a ship). <br><br>
<b>Note:</b> During amphibious assaults, Battleships and Cruisers may bombard any adjacent territory in which an amphibious assault is occurring, regardless of where they unloaded their marines.

<br><br>

<b>Additional National Objectives</b><br><br>

<b>Germany</b>
<ul>
<li>2 PUs if Romania, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Crete are Axis or Pro-Axis controlled.</li>
<li>5 PUs if there is at least one German land unit in either London (the United Kingdom) or Egypt. (This modifies Germany's "Presence in Egypt" objective).</li>
</ul>
<b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if Russia is at war with European Axis, and there are no non-Russian Allied units in any originally Russian territory.</li>
<li>3 PUs for each originally German, Italian, or Pro-Axis neutral territory that Russia controls <b>in mainland Europe.</b> (This modifies Russia's "Spread of Communism" objective). </li>
<li>2 PUs for each of the following Lend-Lease lanes that is "open" (i.e., the specified Sea Zone has no enemy warships and the specified territory is Allied controlled) when Russia is at war with European Axis beyond Round 2: (1) sz 125, Archangel ; (2) sz 80, Persia; (3) sz 5, Amur (This modifies Russia's "Lend Lease" objective).</li>
<li>An additional 2 PUs per each "open" Lend-Lease lane, when Russia is at war with European Axis, if Japan has also declared war on Russia.</li> 
<br>
<b>Note:</b> An Axis power may not move its units into originally Russian territory unless that Axis power is at war with Russia. Also, when not at war with Japan, Russia may not move its units into any non-Russian Allied territory in Asia, other than Syria, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Persia, NorthWest Persia, and East Persia. The National Objective for Russia's first capture of Berlin has been removed.
</ul>

<b>Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>5 PUs if Axis controls Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea, New Britain and Solomon Islands. (This modifies Japan's "Strategic Perimeter" objective).</li>
<li>5 PUs if Axis controls Midway, Wake Island, Guam.</li>
<li>3 PUs if Japan controls Iwo Jima and Okinawa and is at war with the United States.</li>
</ul>

<b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>5 PUs if USA is at war and Allies control Midway, Wake Island, Guam.</li>
<li>5 PUs if USA is at war and Allies control Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Paulau Island, Marianas.</li>
<li>5 PUs if Allies control at least 2 of: Normandy Bordeaux, Holland Belgium, Southern France, and USA has at least one land unit in any of these territories.<b></li>
<li>5 PUs if Allies control Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and USA has at least one land unit in any of these territories.</li>
</ul>

<b>China</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if Allies control Yunnan, Szechwan, Burma, and India. (This modifies China's "Burma Road" objective).</li>
<li>At the start of China's turn, a Chinese infantry is spawned in each non-coastal Chinese territory under Axis control that is not garrisoned by at least one Axis land unit (i.e., infantry, marine, mech infantry, artillery, or armor). These "guerrillas" engage in combat wherever they are spawned and may not be moved until China's next turn. </li>
</ul>


<b>UK</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if UK Europe controls all its original territories. (This modifies UK's "Original Territories" objective).</li>
<li>3 PUs if Allies control at least 2 of: Sicily, Sardinia, Greece, Southern Italy, and Allies have at least one land unit in any of these territories.</li>
<li>3 PUs if there are no enemy submarines in the Atlantic, excluding szs 112 and 125-127.</li>
<li>3 PUs if Malta, Crete, and Cyprus are Allied or Pro-Allied controlled.</li>
<li>3 PUs for UK Pacific when at war with the Japanese if: (1) British control West India and either Egypt or South Africa; and (2) there are no enemy submarines in the western half of the Indian Ocean (sz71,...,sz81).</li>
<li>3 PUs for UK Pacific when at war with the Japanese if Malaya and Kwantung are Allied controlled. (This modifies UK Pacific's "Malaya and Kwantung" objective.</li>

</ul>

<b>Italy</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if Malta, Cyprus, and Crete are Axis controlled.</li>
</ul>

<b>ANZAC</b>
<ul>
<li>3 PUs if ANZAC is at war with the Japanese and Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea, New Britain and Solomon Islands are controlled by the Allies (other than the Dutch). (This modifies ANZAC's "Strategic Islands" objective).</li>
<li>3 PUs if ANZAC is at war with the Japanese and Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, Fiji, and Samoa are Allied controlled.</li>
<li>3 PUs if ANZAC is at war with the Japanese, controls all of its original territories, and Malaya is Allied controlled. (This modifies ANZAC's "Control Original And Malaya" objective).</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<b>**VICHY FRANCE RULE SET**</b>
<br><br>
The following rule-set simulates the circumstances and strategic consequences of the Franco-German Armistice, and is intended for play with the G40 Balance Mod.
<br><br>
<b>Game Conditions for Franco-German Armistice</b> 
<br><br>
At the beginning of France's turn, if the following conditions are met, the Franco-German Armistice will occur:
<br><br>
1. Axis has control of both France and Normandy Bordeaux;<br>
2. Axis has never controlled Southern France; and<br>
3. There are no non-French, Allied land units in Southern France.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Game Consequences of Franco-German Armistice</b>
<br><br>
<b>French Territorial Control:</b> At the beginning of France's first turn in which Armistice conditions are met, all originally French territories not already under Axis control immediately change ownership to Pro-Axis Neutrals, except: (1) French Equatorial Africa; (2) New Hebrides; (2) any French territories containing non-French allied land units.
<br><br>
Any non-French allied air units in Vichy-controlled territory are destroyed upon conversion of the territory to Vichy control.
<br><br>
With the exception of Southern France (see discussion of "Zone Libere" below), Vichy French territory operates the same way as other Pro-Axis Neutral territory. An Axis player may capture Vichy French territory and commandeer its forces by moving a land unit into the territory during the non-combat phase of his turn.
<br><br>
Fly-over restrictions applicable to other Neutral territories do not apply to Vichy French territory.
<br><br>
<b>Fleet at Toulon:</b> In addition to the change in French territorial control, the Armistice changes control of the the French fleet in sz 93, from French to Pro-Axis neutral. The Vichy French fleet maintains a strictly defensive posture. It may not be moved. It may not be captured by the Axis. The fleet is immediately destroyed if any power, other than the Free French, occupies Southern France 
<br><br>
<b>"Zone Libre":</b> Any Axis occupation of Southern France following the Armistice results in the scuttling of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon and the disbandment of all remaining Vichy French forces. These forces are removed at the end of the Axis player's turn in which the occupation of Southern France takes place. Any formerly Vichy French forces that were previously commandeered by the Axis are unaffected by this change.
<br><br>
<b>Armistice's Effect on National Objectives:</b> Following the armistice, Southern France is considered Axis-controlled for purposes of Italy's "Roman Empire" objective. Otherwise, the Vichy France arrangement has no impact on National Objectives. Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco must still be directly occupied by Germany or Italy to achieve Italy's "North Africa" objective. Japanese occupation of French Indo China still negates Japan's "Trade With America" objective. 
<br><br>
<b>Liberation of France:</b> The Allied liberation of France effectively terminates the Armistice. Any territory and forces still under Vichy French control (including any surviving fleet in sz 93) revert back to Free French control. The Vichy French forces in the Southern France and sz 93 will also revert back if Southern France is liberated by the Free French. 
<br><br>
<br><hr><br>
<b>Note</b><br>
This game uses the latest Global 1940 2nd Edition (successor to Alpha +3) rules, as posted on Larry's website.<br>
To blitz move mech_infantry with armour, you must click on them both at the same time (use CTRL to create waypoints).<br>
Paratroopers tech enables a second combat movement phase which happens right after the first combat movement phase, and the second one only allowes movement of paratrooping infantry.<br>
<br>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
The game is not meant to take over your responsibility in knowing the rules. For example, the game engine is not always going to restrict or allow certain attacks. 
It is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them. Most of the game notes that follow can be thought of as differences compared to WWIIv3 or WWIIv4 rules but obviously are not a complete manual for the game. 
Beginners to these games are suggested to ask for help in the lobby or on the forums at http://www.tripleawarclub.org<br>
You must always validate your own movement, especially air movement at sea.  The engine is not perfect.<br>
<br>

<b>Edit Mode</b><br>
If you ever need to create new UK units, always create "British" units, do not create "UK_Pacific" units (except for Factories and facilities, all UK_Pacific units turn into British units when placed normally).<br>
The Warbonds technology will give the PUs to the British, please use edit mode if you want some of it to go to UK Pacific.<br>
You may also need to use edit mode to correct things listed below.<br>
<br>

<br>Below is a list of rules that the TripleA game engine either does not enforce, or enforces incorrectly, at this point.
<br>Each item starts with a code in parentheses that represents how you may fix or correct the rule.
<br>(PE) = Player Enforced = You must be aware of the rule and must follow it. The engine will not stop you from breaking the rule.
<br>(CL) = Comment Log = You must record what you are doing in the comment log, because TripleA does not keep that information around. (To access the comment log, go to the 'view' menu, and click 'show comment log', then type a comment there.)
<br>(SR) = Save/Reload = You may save the game now or at the start of the phase, then reload it, in order to solve this problem.
<br>(EM) = Edit Mode = You must use Edit Mode to correct or fix the error, because the engine either disallows the rule or otherwise does something wrong that you can correct.
<br>(NA) = None Available = There is no fix available for this yet.
<br>
<br><b>Rules specific to 1940 the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (EM) You may ask for permission during your turn to move through a canal owned by a power you are not yet at war with (use edit mode to move them).
<br>* (CL) TripleA does not keep track of which neutral territories have been previously attacked (use comment log to keep track of this instead).
<br>* (PE) You are not allowed to blitz or move any units through Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You may not land air units in Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You can not fly over unfriendly neutrals, unless they are being attacked or they have previously been attacked.
<br>* (PE) Friendly Neutrals can not be 'captured' with an AA Gun, only by land units with an attack power.
<br>* (PE) You may not build facilities on territories that were Dutch at the start of your turn.
<br>* (PE) You may not attack a territory containing units owned by a nation that you are not at war with (even if the territory is owned by someone you are at war with).
<br>* (PE) USA may not end movement in seazone adjacent to Japanese controlled territories when not at war with Japan (Sea Zones 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 33, 34, 36, and 37).
<br>* (EM) Japan can fly over UK and French territories before going to war with them.
<br>* (EM) USA does not have to declare war at the end of USA 3 if they do not want to.
<br>* (PE) You may not conduct an amphibious assault from an allied transport if the defender could scramble and you have no other combat units to protect that transport.
<br>* (EM) If Russia is at war with Italy, but not with Germany, a German warship in sz125 will cancel Russia's national objective (and same if at war with Germany but not Italy, and there is an Italian boat in sz125).
<br>* (EM) If UK Pacific captures Japan, the money should go to UK Pacific, even if UK Pacific's capital is occupied.
<br>* (EM) You must place all units you purchased if you are able to, or as many as you can. Any units not placed get refunded to you (TripleA instead carries them over to the next turn).
<br>* (PE) The victory conditions must be held for a full continuous round after they are achieved (so for example if Italy takes Egypt as the 8th European VC, then the Axis must hold 8 VCs continuously until Italy's next turn).
<br>* (EM) Rocket damage to an airfield should occur after scrambling, which means if an airbase is disabled by the rocket attack, it could still scramble this turn.
<br>* (PE) Paratroopers (airborne) may not attack multiple territories from a single airbase.
<br>
<br><b>General rules for all A&A games that the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (PE) Battles should be resolved in this order: all SBR, then all Amphibious Assaults, then all others.
<br>* (SR or EM) Repairing and Purchase are should actually be done at the same time.
<br>* (CL) TripleA does keep track of which units are on which transports, but there is no easy way to see this information when it is not your turn.
<br>* (CL) TripleA should, but does not keep track of which air units are on which carriers.
<br>* (PE) All air moved must have a way of potentially being picked up or landing, and all air that survives combat MUST be picked up if possible.
<br>* (PE) TripleA should not allow non-combat moves to be done during combat move phase.
<br>* (PE) Only non-air units that did not move during combat move and did not participate in combat, may move during non-combat-move.
<br>* (PE) Transports can only be loaded in 1 phase (not both), and unloaded in 1 phase (not both).
<br>* (PE) Transports if unloading for amphibious assault must unload all units loaded in the combat move phase and may not hold back some units while offloading other units unless the units held back were loaded in previous rounds.
<br>* (NA) Each phase of combat should have all units in that phase fire before any casualty selection occurs, whereas right now in TripleA if air and subs are involved then units might be broken up into smaller groups and casualty selection done for each group.
<br>* (EM) If you select for a bombardment from a sea zone, you should be able to select which units you want to have bombard, but currently all possible units are used.
<br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Political Situation</b><br>
At the start of the game Germany and Italy are at war with the UK and ANZAC and France only, while Japan is at war with China only. Any countries not at war with each other ignore each other's naval units and obviously cannot go into each others ground territories. There are a number of specific politically related rules/conditions for each country:<br><br>

<b>Germany/Italy/Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>Germany/Italy/Japan can declare war on USA or Russia or China at any time.</li>
<li>If Germany/Italy/Japan is at war with one of USA or Russia or China it doesn't affect relations with the other.</li>
<li>While not yet at war with the USA, Japan may not move into sea zones within 2 spaces of Western USA or Alaska.</li>
<li>If Japan attacks a Russian territory next to Mongolia, all Mongolian territories and units are transferred to Russia. This does not occur if Russia previously attacked Korea or any Japan-controlled territory bordering Mongolia.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>Russia cannot go to war against the Germans and Italians until the <b>beginning of purchase units phase</b> of Russia 4, unless of course they attack it first, or the Axis capture London.</li>
<li>Russia and Japan may declare war on each other at any time.  When not at war, Russia may not enter China.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>If USA is not at war with Germany or Italy, USA may only move its units to sea zones touching USA territories and also Sea Zone 102.</li>
<li>If USA is not at war with Japan, USA may not move its units into sea zones touching Japanese controlled territories.</li>
<li>USA cannot go to war against the Axis until the <b>beginning of PU collect phase</b> of USA 3, unless of course an Axis power attacks it first.</li>
<li>Once at war, the Minor Factories in continental USA upgrade to Major Factories automatically for free, and may be used immediately.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Neutrals</b><br>
There are three types of neutrals: 
<ul>
<li>pro-Axis: When an Axis unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>pro-Allies: When an Allied unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>Regular: If a power attacks a regular neutral, all the other regular neutrals on the board become friendly to the other team.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Capture of friendly neutrals must be done during Non Combat Movement.<br><br>

When a country moves into a regular or non-friendly neutral during the combat move, it must conduct combat with the number of infantry specified on the map for that neutral. If it loses or retreats, however many infantry that remain are how many that stay in the zone. This means that if Finland was +4 for Axis, and Russia kills 2 infantry and retreats, then Axis only get 2 infantry when they move into Finland.

<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Kamikaze Attacks</b><br>
Japan starts the game with 6 attack tokens, and may begin doing Kamikaze Attacks at the start of the game.<br>
These attacks can only be done in sea zones that contain the Kamikaze symbol [the sea zones surrounding: Japan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, and the Marianas].<br>
At the end of Japan's enemy's combat-move phase, Japan may target any surface warship in a Kamikaze zone for one or more Kamikaze attacks, ONLY if the enemy is attacking Japanese units there or is conducting an Amphibious Assault from that sea zone.<br>
For each attack, a die is rolled, and a 2 or less is considered a hit. Casualties are removed immediately, and do not participate in any battles. Kamikaze attacks prevent bombardment as well.<br>
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Submarines Prevent Unescorted Transports From Making Amphibious Assaults</b><br>
In any Sea Zone containing an enemy submarine, but not containing an owned warship, the submarine will prevent the offloading of troops for an amphibious assault. 
<br><br><hr><br>


<b>Scrambling</b><br>
Fighters and/or Tactical bombers can be scrambled from any territory bordering a sea zone, with an operating airfield (less than 3 damage) to help defend the surrounding sea zone using their standard defense values. They cannot retreat from scrambling (defenders can never retreat) and if the territory they were scrambled from is captured, they're given one extra movement point to land on a friendly territory or open carrier. Scrambled air cannot participate in any other battles that round.
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Strategic Bombing Runs (SBR)</b><br>
Bombing can now happen against both types of ICs, harbours, and airfields (attackers choice)[tactical bombers can not target factories though]. Fighters can participate in the bombing run as escorts. Fighters in the territory being bombed can be launched as interceptors (no airfield necessary).<br><br>
<b>If interceptors are launched:</b> a one-round air battle takes place right away all air involved roll at 1 (jets rolls at 2). Either attacking bombers or fighters can be taken as casualties.<br><br>
After the air battle, or if there were no interceptors, the escorts are retreated and any bombers/tacs remaining can now be divied up to attack specific targets. Each target rolls its built-in AA gun against the bombers/tacs targetting it. If there is an AA gun in the territory being bombed it does <b>not</b> roll because its there to defend combat units and not complexes/bases.
<br><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Blockade Zones</b><br>
If any enemy ships are in a power's blockade zones at the end of that power's turn, and the power controls the adjacent ground territory, then the power may lose some of the PUs it would have otherwise collected.<br>
Surface warships roll 1 dice, Submarines and Air units roll 2 dice, and carriers and transports roll zero dice.  For any roll of 3 or less, that amount of PUs will not be collected by the surrounding land territories.
The power in question cannot lose more PUs from a blockade zones then the worth of the adjacent ground territory to those zones.

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Placement Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 3 or more, and must be originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 2 or more.</li>
<li>Industrial Complexes can't be built on islands.</li>
<li>Over-purchase is returned and money is reimbursed.</li>
<li>Aircraft can be placed on the ground or on a [new] carrier in the adjacent sea zone that has a spot(s) open.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>

<b>Units</b><br>
These changes to units are things other than price/movement which you can see in the buy menu.
<ul>
<li>Bombers now do 2 additional damage in strategic bombing raids, in addition to their dice roll.</li>
<li>Carriers are two hit.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes have 3 production capacity. A Minor IC can be upgraded to a Major IC for 20 PUs, but only on originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes have 10 production capacity. When a Major IC is captured it automatically becomes a minor IC.</li>
<li>AA Guns may be taken casualty in combat, and may only fire at up to 3 aircraft each.</li>
</ul>

<b>New Units</b><br>
<b>Tactical Bombers:</b> can land on carriers, can bomb, and if paired with <b>a tank or fighter</b> the Tac attacks at 4. Tactical Bombers can also strategic bomb Airfields and Harbours (but not factories).<br>
<b>Mechanized Infantry:</b> can blitz when paired with a tank, and are supportable by artillery.<br>
<b>Carriers:</b> now have 2 hitpoints, and when damaged they do not allow fighters to land, or to leave if cargo.<br>
<br>
<b>New Buildings</b><br>
<b>Harbour:</b> Any ships that start their turn in a sea zone adjacent to a harbour get +1 movement points. Any damaged ships are repaired by a harbour at the start of the player's purchase and repair turn phase. Lastly, harbours can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the above bonuses.<br>
<b>Airfield:</b> Any air that start their turn on the ground territory with an airfield get +1 movement points. Airfields allow up to 3 planes on that island to scramble (see Scramble section above). Airfields can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the movement bonus.
