<b>G 40 Expansion</b><br>
<br>
This is a House Rule Mod for "Global 1940 Second Edition". It was Created by The Captain and Company. They can be reached here:
<br><br><b>g40expansionrules@gmail.com</b>
<br>
<br>
and here:<br><br><b>https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/36945/axis-allies-global-1940-house-rules-expansion/36</b><br><br>
The rules can be found here:<br><br><b>https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ycmW7VYZfsoR1ZeoV_tzXLzpp6H-2r-/view</b><br>
<br>
This mod will play more like a TableTop game than most triplea maps. While there is the need for edit use, it is completely playable and will become second nature after a few games. It's <b>Huge</b> upside is well worth the effort.<br>
<br>
The following is just going to address the triplea game play, although the Help button top right has some Unit information. You will need to read the rules download for full game information.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
<br>
If needing to use edit after combat move and before combat and there will be only 1 battle, you will need to edit <b>before</b> your combat move, as after,  you will go straight to the battle without being able to edit. If multiple battles are taking place, you will be able to edit before the first battle is fought to <b>remove</b> units but not place. Actually, you can place but they will have no effect on the battle. <br>
<br>
If using Edit to move units in combat move, it may take you over an unintended route which will conquer empty enemy territories. Use Edit to adjust after combat.<br>
<br>
If Hand Rolling for Landmines, Paratrooper or UBoat battles, you will have to state there intended attack and then roll and then edit units accordingly. You can't edit if having already moved from a territory.<br>
<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
3 Infantry attack from Eastern Poland to Belarus and must cross 3 Landmines. E POL is also going to send units to other attacks. Roll for the 3 Landmines and then use Edit to remove any hits/Landmines as necessary. Then do your normal combat moves.<br>
<br>
You may only use Edit to move units during Combat and NonCombat Move and only for the Player whose turn it is.<br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
Some Pacific Island Bonuses don't activate correctly. Currently, if you conquer an opposing Players Territory and then lose it, it will only give the negative bonus for that turn. All proceeding turns will not give the negative bonus. If/when you reconquer the Territory, it will work correctly for that turn and then revert to previous behaviour.
 <br>
<br>
Use Edit to correct.<br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes triplea will not allow you to make a legal landing on a Carrier. Use edit to replace Units as needed.

<br>
<br>
Use Edit to correct.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br><br>
Battleship Bombard does not work with LCVs. You can Hand roll the Battle or use Edit to temporarily add a Transport(s) then Edit the correct Unit total at end of Combat.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b><br><br>If Attacking a Sea Zone with a Unable to Defend Transport, Ignore Transport if you want to Bombard and then use Edit to Kill the Transport if you had enough Units to do so.<br><br>
<b><NOTE</b>
When replacing Units with Edit, most starting Units will be on the Left side of the Window.<br><br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You may be able to Edit Territory Control and then change Units, then change back without undoing your moves. This may cause movement problems, especially for Air, so be aware.<br><br>
<b>Section I</b><br>
<br>
<b>United Kingdom One Economy</b><br>
<br>
UK may only spend 20 PUs in the Pacific Theatre. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>China Bonus Infantry</b><br>
<br>
China has it's Game Start income boosted by 3 PUs to represent the added Infantry. It also has a 3 PU National Objective. It will not show up in the Objectives tab but does show at end turn.<br>
<br>
<b>Weapons Developement</b><br>
<br>
You may activate tech in Early 1943, Round 7, in "Map Options". You will need to save the game and turn on before restarting game.<br>
<br>
<b>Double Place Phase</b><br>
<br>
Waffen Infantry, Waffen Panzer, Commandos, Marines, Unarmed Mines, Waffen Paratroopers, Waffen Artillery, Wolfpacks and Underground Factories are all placed in the First Placement Phase. Everything else as normal.<br>
If placing both a Minor Factory and a Underground Minor, Place the Minor in the first phase and the Underground in the second.<br>
<br><b>NOTE</b><br>
Only Place Units that are activated that turn in the First Place Phase.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Soviet Guard Infantry</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Waffen Infantry</b><br>
<br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Otherwise they work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
When using the "Basic" Rules, you need to purchase the "Waffen_Infantry2" Unit, which will show up on the bottom right of the Purchase Window.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Waffen Panzer</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>4 and 5. British Commandos and USA Marines</b><br>
<br>
Commando/Marine units now attack at 2 and get +1 when paired with Artillery. If attacking by themselves, you need to edit in a CommandoA1/MarineA1 unit.<br>
<br>
You will also need to edit when placing in a Allied Factory. Purchase a "1_PU" and then replace an Infantry with a Marine/Commando in the Allied Factory.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Elite Infantry</b><br>
<br>
You may only have 1 Elite in any Territory at any one time. This includes Allied Elites. This is Player Enforced. If you are forced to retreat to a Territory that has another Elite or Allied Elite, kill them with edit before Non Combat Move.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
When being supported by Artillery and other Artillery supportable units are present, the Artillery sometimes will support only 1 of the Elite's rolls as well as 1 other unit. So, the Elite will show up in the "1" category in the "Battle Window", but the rolls will be correct.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Paratroopers</b><br>
Paratroopers Move 2 and +1 from an Airfield. Player Enforce correct land movement of 1 move only. Paratroopers may require edit for their "Air Movement". Before attacking, if facing AA fire, activate "Roll Dice" under "Game", top left, and roll for AA fire. Then use edit to kill any hits and if needed, select "Perform Move Or Other Actions" and then click on the Paratrooper and make a legal move. If there is only 1 battle to be fought that Combat Phase, you will need to do this at the <b>START</b> of your Combat Move.<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
 If accompanied by Air Units during an edit assisted attack across water, along with other ground Units performing an <b>Amphibious Attack</b> , All Paras <b>MUST</b> die before retreating the Air Units or the game will freeze.<br>
If no accompanying ground Units, you can't retreat the Air Units until <b>ALL</b> Paras are dead. It will then throw a "Withdraw" error when you retreat the remaining Planes, but that is one you can ignore.<br>
This is the only truly serious issue in the mod.<br>
<br>
They will also be allowed to retreat from Land Battles. This is a legal move.<br>
<br>
Instead of a A3 bonus for first round only, the Para will fire one AA shot at 2, along with it's normal A1. The AA shot's casualties do not get to fire back. Instead of a D3 bonus for first round only, the Para will fire one AA shot at 1, along with it's normal D2. The AA shot's casualties do not get to fire back.
<br>
<br>
Also, it receives no Artillery support during land attacks, which helps to balance the First Strike AA kills.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You may wish to roll Paratrooper only battles (attacking or defending) by hand according to the Global 40 Expansion Rules.<br>
<br> 
This was the most challenging unit for the engine. I've run several simulated battle scenarios and think it plays fine though. You just need to be deliberate in your steps the first few times. So you may want to save in between turns/phases and fight the Para battles first in case of any mistakes, until you get comfortable with it.<br>
<br>
<b>Also</b> if you are only doing 1 attack that phase, don't forget to turn off edit before ending your Combat Move. Otherwise, it will go straight to Battle and you can't turn edit off then.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If moving with edit, it may take an unintended route and conquer empty Enemy Territories in the process. You may move with your intended course and stop when triplea deviates from your intended path, or edit unintended Territories to correct ownership.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Lend-Lease</b><br>
<br>
After the Allied Players Non Combat Move is finished, use edit and place the appropiate Lend-Lease Unit with the corresponding Unit. On Russia’s turn, purchase “1_PU” for every Lend Lease Unit you want to accept. On First Place phase, place the 1_PU where the Lend Lease Unit is and then use edit to remove the Lend-lease Units and add the Soviet ones. The “1_PU” Unit will remove itself before Combat Move.<br>
<br>
This is to maintain correct PU levels.<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If The Lend-Lease Units come under attack before Russia's turn, don't take the Lend-Lease image as a hit. It will auto die if the battle is lost.<br>
Player Enforced Unit Limits. You may want to use the "Comment Log" under View, Top left, to keep track of how many Units have been sent.<br>
<br> 
<b>9. Facilities</b><br>
<br>
<b>Underground Factories</b>.<br>
Purchase a Demolition Unit for Free on the turn you want to destroy them. You don’t have to use it, although you may want to place and edit the Factory back, so it won’t stay in your Purchased Units list if you don’t use it.<br>
<br>
Don’t place and destroy same turn. Player Enforced.  Use edit to downgrade while moving.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
When replacing a Heavy Major or Minor Factory with an Underground Factory, you will need to use Edit. They will replace non upgraded Factories correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>Russian Factories</b>.<br> 
While the Factory can move on it's own, you will need to keep track of Rail movement usage. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>Demolition of Airfields and Harbours</b>.<br>
These work correctly. Purchase the appropriate Demolition Unit and plant the explosives at the targeted Facility during the second Place Phase. The Facility will detonate at end turn. It will auto destruct before next enemy combat move.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Non-Agression Pacts</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to add units after combat move and adjust PU levels. Ignore second DOW notice when either Italy or Germany attack.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Strategic Bombing</b><br>
<br>
You can't designate certain Fighters to protect certain Facilities. The Air Battles will be fought in one battle.<br> 
So if you send 2 Fighter Escorts and 2 Bombers with 2 Interceptors defending and the Bombers are Bombing separate targets, there will be one Air Battle with all planes. You may choose your own Air casualties. Triplea will randomly select AA casualties. They will select Bombers or Tac Bombers only.<br>
<br>
<b>Section II</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. The Expanded Pacific Ocean</b><br>
<br>
<b>Important</b><br>
<br>
Some Pacific Island Bonuses don't activate correctly. Currently, if you conquer an opposing Players Territory and then lose it, it will only give the negative bonus for that turn. All proceeding turns will not give the negative bonus. If/when you reconquer the Territory, it will work correctly for that turn and then revert to previous behaviour.
 <br>
Use Edit to correct.<br>
<br>
Allied Land Units in New Guinea are able to activate the Bonus PUs for Dutch New Guinea in Combat Move before it is conquered by Japan. This is unintended and is Player Enforced. You may still take control in Non Combat Move.<br>
<br> Also in the Rare instance USA is in positon to enter Dutch New Guinea first, you will need to Player Enforce that it doesn't. <br><br>
Defenders from different Players, may or may not, incorrectly activate the negative bonus if Japan conquers. Use Edit if needed.<br>
<br>After round 30 you will need to use edit for correct PU behavior.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>2. Increased Ship Building</b><br>
<br>
Movement Restrictions are Player Enforced. The 2 Naval Fighters placed in "Late 1942" will always place. Use edit to correct Unit total if needed.<br>
<br>
May be turned off with map option "The Expanded Pacific Ocean".<br>
<br>
<b>3. Heavy Industry Production</b><br>
<br>
Only Factories at Game Start can be upgraded. Player Enforced. Use First Place Phase and edit if necessary, when placing multiple upgrades at once.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Landmine</b><br>
<br>
This requires extensive edit use. There is also a TripleA option that is "edit free" explained below.<br>
<br>
You may purchase "unarmed" mines and place them in your Capital and India for UK. It will allow you to place as many as you want, so placement is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Use edit to place “Armed” mines. Use the Player “Changer” for these. You may place them anywhere there is an unarmed mine (including ones you purchased that turn). When you place the armed mines, you will need to use the “Comment Log” stating which Border they are defending in the territory. To access the comment log, go to the “View” menu, and click “Show Comment Log”.<br>
<br>
You may also place “Colored” mines: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Orange. This will allow you to edit different mines designating the defense of different borders. As a guideline, you may way want to use no color for West, Blue for North, Red for South and Yellow for East. Green for Northwest and Southeast and Orange for Southwest and Northeast to make it easier to tell how many and where they defend are.<br>
<br>
Use comment log to clarify. A notepad next to your keyboard with the information may also prove useful, after the initial documentation.<br>
<br>
Using the mines in combat requires use of the "Dice Roller". It is located in the "Game" menu next to View. If only 1 battle is to take place, at the <b>START</b> of your combat move, determine how many units are crossing the minefield and roll as many dice as there are armed mines. Use edit to remove any casualties and any mines that detonated. Excess mine hits are not removed.<br>
<br> You <b>must</b> do any edits <b>before</b> starting the combat move if there is to be only 1 battle that phase. So, if needed, do a dry run and note the units entering the minefield. Use comment log if necessary.<br>
<br>
If there will be multiple battles, you will be able to edit before the first battle takes place. <br>
<br>
The Dice Roller is not tracked in "History" so you may use the comment log if you want to keep a record of the rolls/hits. If playing by Forum, it is recommended to use the Axis & Allies.org dice roller.<br>
<br>
You may load no more than 3 mines on a transport. This is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Do not take mines as casualties in combat. Player enforced. When a territory is conquered, all the unarmed mines will be destroyed. Armed Changer mines will be unaffected.<br>
<br>
Use the same procedure as above, for any units that cross the minefield in non combat move.<br>
<br>
Mines will block blitz movement. Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" to make a legal move.<br>
<br>
<b>TripleA Landmines</b><br>
The “armed” mines are D2 now. They only die after getting a hit or taken as a casualty. They roll separately from the rest of the defending units, so you can see if they hit or not. You can place as many as there are “unarmed” mines, so you’ll have to player enforce any territory limits. They will defend against attacks from any border.<br>
<br> 
May be turned on in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>5. Escorts & Transports</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to place and remove the "Escort Convoy" unit when Convoys are formed or dispersed. Transports must be taken as casualties last. This is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Do not attack Subs without a Destroyer present. This is also Player Enforced. If you have a mixed Fleet without Destroyers attacking Subs, allocate the Escort hits to other Vessels when possible. If Subs submerge after first round of combat, use edit to replace any illegal Escort hits at the end of combat. If they don't submerge, then count any Escort hits. <br>
<br>
Do not take Transports as casualties the first three rounds Player Enforced. You will have to kill them in battle, so you may want to quit battle and edit accordingly or continue battle till they're all dead.<br>
<br>
Use "Roll Dice" for Bombard Attacks with only D1 Transports defending. Ignore the Sea Battle results and/or use edit if needed.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>6. US National Guard</b><br>
<br>
The National Guard Units will deploy with any state of war with Japan. Use edit to remove them if illegally placed.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>7. Carrier Based Fighter Aircraft</b><br>
<br>
Movement Restrictions are Player Enforced. Use edit for making legal landing moves when Carrier is sunk or damaged. If caught in land combat, use edit to remove them. If only 1 battle to take place that Combat Phase, you must edit  before starting combat move, then replace them if needed after combat.<br>
<br>
The 2 Naval Fighters placed in "Late 1942" will always place. Use edit to correct Unit total if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Defensive Fortifications</b><br>
<br>
Only place as many as there are Infantry present. Place in 2nd Place Phase only. These are Player Enforced.<br>
Do Not take as casualties. If they lose battle, they will auto die. If they win, remove any excess Fortifications with edit after combat.<br>
<br>
Use edit for Italy and Russia in the unlikely event they are needed.<br>
<br>
<b>9. German Atlantic Wall</b><br>
<br>
Only place as many as there are Infantry present. Place in 2nd Place Phase only. These are Player Enforced.<br>
Do Not take as casualties. If they lose battle, they will auto die. If they win, remove any excess Atlantic Wall units with edit after combat.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Capital Warships Taking Damage</b><br>
<br>
Don't attack with Damaged Carriers. Take Carriers as first hit when Battleships are present. These are Player Enforced. Don't take "Defend CV Hit" as a casualty in Land Combat. This is also Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
1 "Repair Carrier" or "Repair BB" Unit will repair <b>All</b> damaged Ships. Make sure to buy the appropriate amount of repair units. Player Enforced. They will auto die after combat move. Use edit to place in open sea. This may be fixed in the future.<br>
<br>
Only scramble to the disabled Carrier's Sea Zone with the "Defend CV" Unit. Do not take as a hit in Land Combat. Do Not use any designated Fighters for other actions while on Carrier Defense Duty. These are all Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Place the "Defend CV" Unit during the 2nd Place Phase. It will auto remove before your next Purchase Phase.<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
If you didn't purchase a free Defend CV unit, simply edit one in after your turn.<br>
<br>
If damage is taken to a Battleship, you will need to edit to "BB_Damaged" and "Pac_BB_Damaged" before non combat move, so they will have a attack factor of zero. You will also need to edit 1 hit of damage. Turn on edit and then click on the Battleship to add damage.<br>
<br>
<b>11. Super Heavy Battleship</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
The "SHB" will fire 2 Bombard shots, even if only 1 amphibous unit is attacking. Use the Dice Roller to simulate the bombardment and for any casualties to fire back. Then use edit to adjust accordingly. If you have more than 1 battle taking place, you will be able to use edit before choosing the first battle to fight. If only 1 battle is being fought, it will go straight to combat after your combat move. You will need to edit before your combat move in that case.<br>
<br>
If damage is taken in combat, you will need to edit to "Hvy_BB_Dmgd" and "German_Hvy_BB_Dmgd" before non combat move, so they will have a attack factor of zero. You will also need to edit 1 or 2 hits of damage. Turn on edit and then click on the Battleship to add damage.<br>
<br>
<b>Section III</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. US Armoured Infantry</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. German Panzer Grenadiers</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Strategic Rail Movement</b><br>
<br>
Each Major Power's Rail Units will place before Combat Move. Germany, Russia, the United States and Italy, will place in their Capitals. Britain will place in South Africa and China in Kansu. <br>
<br>You must control your Capital for units to place. China needs USA Capital. <br>
<br>
This is to help remind the Player of it's non combat move availability. They will not be able to move in combat move. The one with a "E" on it is for Europe movement. This is to keep track of rail movement. <br>
<br>
A rail unit will move any unit regardless of theatre.<br>
Click on the Rail unit and then click the unit you want to move.<br>
<br>
Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" if necessary to make your move.<br>
<br> 
Correct movement is Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Home Defense</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to place the 2 Japanese Infantry. Use the Dice roller to roll the first round battles and edit to remove casualties <b>before</b> start of combat.<br>
<br>
So, do your combat move. Manually roll first round of battle. Then end combat move. Then edit to remove casualties. Then start combat phase.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Landing Craft</b><br>
<br>
Only take as casualty when Attacking in Land Battles. They will Auto Die when only units left in battle. Player Enforced. Roll Scramble Battles in the Dice Roller <b>before</b> starting Combat Phase.<br>
<br>
Use edit "Perform Move or Other Actions" for movement across Sea Zones. You will need to click on the units it's carrying as well.
<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
 If accompanied by Air Units during an attack, you won't be able to retreat Air Units during battle. If necessary, save game, reroll battle accordingly using the triplea Dice Roller located in "View" top left of screen and then edit correct outcome.<br>
<br>
<b>6. D-Day</b><br>
<br> 
Move all USA Land Units to participate in D-Day to UK. Do not move any Air or Naval Units that will participate in D-Day. Use Comment log if necessary. Finish the rest of USA's turn.<br>
<br>
On UK turn, make <b>All</b> non D-Day combat moves. Catalogue in comment log. Hit undo. Then use edit to add all USA D-Day units as British ( use "artillleryTG" for ArmoredInfantry ), to United Kingdom. Sea and Air Units to where they were on USA turn. Refer to comment log if needed.<br>
<br>
Now do all UK combat moves. Can either do D-day first or non D-day ones. Whichever seems more effecient.<br>
<br>
After combat, use edit to replace UK units with the appropriate USA units and change territory control to Americans if invasion was successful. Refer to comment log if needed.<br>
<br>
It's an involved turn, but only happens once a game, so not game breaking. Hopefully someone will redraw the map in the future, adding a D-Day box, as well as boxes for the Army Groups and Corps.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Red Army Conscription</b><br>
<br>
Placement Restrictions Player Enforced. So no more than 20 in Moscow and 6 in the Minor Factorys. Max build of 26 <b>is</b> enforced.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>8. German U-boats</b><br>
<br>
"Wolfpack" units are A0 D0 C3 units with unlimited movement. They give 1 AA shot of +1 on offense and +2 on defense to each U-Boat in it's sea zone for 1 round only.<br>
Any hits will not be able to fire back, regardless of enemy Destroyers being present.<br>
<br>
You may place Wolfpack units in <b>any</b> sea zone next to German controlled territories. Use edit if needed to place elsewhere. Place them in the First place phase so they can be used that turn.<br>
They have unlimited movement but will still be blocked by Destroyers, so use "Perform Move Or Other Actions" in edit if needed. Otherwise, you must place before starting your combat move.<br>
Sea zone 113 is usually a good place for Wolfpack units waiting to be formed.<br>
<br>
Do not take as casualties. They will auto die if they are the only units left. They still need to be hit though, so if you get tired of rolling, simply submerge Wolfpack and kill him with edit at the end of the phase. <br>
<br>
After combat, triplea will remove any Wolfpack units that are in the Atlantic Ocean or Mediterranean Sea that no longer meet the requirement for a Wolfpack, before the Germans non combat move.<br>
You will need to use edit to remove any additional Wolfpacks before Germany's next combat move, if enemy attacks have done the same.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
You may wish to roll Submarine only battles (attacking or defending) by hand according to the Global 40 Expansion Rules.<br>
<br> 
<b>9. Waffen Paratroopers</b><br>
<br>
Move 3 with +1 from Airfield. Player Enforce correct land movement of 1 move only. Use Dice Roller for AA fire. You may need to use edit to make combat or non combat moves with "Perform Move or Other Actions" same as Wehrmacht Paratroopers. If still not possible to make legal move, edit directly at start of phase. May not attack Capitals. Player Enforced. Max Builds Player Enforced. They <b>are</b> supported by Waffen Artillery.<br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options".<br>
<br>
<b>10. Waffen Artillery</b><br>
<br>
Edit to "Waffen_ArtyPG" when inside of a Waffen Army, so it doesn't use it's artillery support bonus.<br>
<br>
<b>Section IV</b><br>
<br>
<b>1. Soviet Tank Mass Production </b><br>
<br>
They work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Waffen Panzer Grenadiers</b><br>
<br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Otherwise they work correctly.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Waffen Oberst-Gruppenführer</b><br>
<br>
There are "4" Oberst. The one you can purchase is not currently in command of a Waffen Army. Depending on the configuration of the Army, use edit to replace the Oberst with a "2", "3" or "4" Oberst. This will boost the appropriate A2, A3 and A4 units.<br>
<br>
Always take the Oberst as the First casualty of the Army. Otherwise it will continue to roll twice and give it's bonus roll to the designated unit.<br>
<br>
Use edit to replace a Waffen Army unit that survives and retreats, with the Oberst who was killed, if needed for regrouping in non combat move.<br>
<br>
For example. You have 2 Waffen Infantry, a Waffen Panzer and a Oberst. You decide to create a Waffen Army with the Oberst giving it's bonus roll to the Panzer by using edit to replace the Oberst with "Oberst 4" <b>before</b> the start of your combat move.<br>
<br>
When more than 1 Waffen Army is present in a territory, only 1 Army can use it's bonus rolls. Use regular Oberst for other Armies.<br>
When attacking, all units in the Army must start in same territory. Player Enforced.<br>
<br>
Edit in the "artilleryPG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will not support Waffen Units.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Soviet Commissar</b><br>
<br>
They behave the same as the Waffen Oberst-Gruppenführer.<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberTG" and "artilleryTG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support nor support Infantry Units.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Panzer General</b><br>
<br>
Only build 1 per turn. Player Enforced. Use the Oberst and Commisar procedure for correct game play. Panzer General3 is the combat active one.<br>
<br>
When in Cmbat, Kill the PG first if you won't have enough units left to keep the Army active otherwise it will continue to give bonus. Use edit to replace after battle if needed.<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberPG/TG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Army Group</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to place an Army Group Flag. There are 2 Flags. "Army Group Active" is the Flag for receiving the combat bonus.<br>
<br>
<b>7. German Take Over of Italy</b><br>
<br>
Use edit to change unit and territory control. Also use edit to adjust PU levels and any Damage to Facilities. <br>
The extra Para and LCV build limits are Player Enforced. National Objectives will not show up in the Objectives tab. They will be listed at end of turn and in History.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Total War</b><br>
<br>
Placement number is Player Enforced. Only place during 2nd plase phase or they won't change. If unable to place in a legal spot, use edit. This should be a rare occurence.<br>
<br>
Navy Fighters must be placed in Japan and Western United States. Use edit to move them to their correct Sea Zones.<br>
<br>
<b>9. Air Transport</b><br>
<br>
Movement is Player Enforced. They can move 6, or 7 with Airfield, whether loaded or not. Only Germany may transport Panzers. Player Enforced. <br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
They won't reset if you select from all units. Best to load one at a time. May need to restart game if unable to edit correct behavior.<br>
<br>
<b>Section V Optional Rules</b><br>
<br>
May be turned off in "Map Options" before Game Start.<br>
<br> 
<b>1. Soviet Partisans</b><br>
<br>
You can purchase and place in any soviet controlled territory. You will need to then use edit, to place where you want and remove. This is to keep track of PU levels.<br>
<br>
You need to use edit to kill/remove any Partisans your units come into contact with. Also to change from 2 Partisans to 1 Infantry.<br> 
<br>
If only 1 Partisan in territory, it will conquer it during combat phase. You will need to edit desired results.<br>
<br>
<b>2. German Volkssturm</b><br>
<br>
When conditions are met, save game and before restarting, turn on in Map options. You can either turn on and off as needed, or Player Enforce if conditions no longer legal.<br>
<br>
<b>3. German Me 262 Jet Fighter</b><br>
<br>
These work correctly. 
<br>
<br>
<b>4. German King Tiger Tank</b><br>
<br>
Max Build is Player Enforced. Per turn build of 3, is Player Enforced. They can be repaired anywhere. Use the above procedure for repairing Battleships and Carriers.<br>
Repair unit will not repair Battleship or Carrier.
<br>
<br>
It is actually easier to use edit for the repairs, as their combat values do not change the way Battleships do. <br>
<br>
<b>5. Waffen Heavy Tank</b><br>
<br>
These work correctly. Use same repair procedure as above. Uses same place procedure as other Waffen Units.
<br>
<br>
<b>6. Japanese Banzai Attack</b><br>
<br>
Will auto place 1 Banzai unit per turn in Japan. Has unlimited movement. Do not take as casualty in battle. Use only for legal attacks. Player Enforced.<br>
Will auto die at End Turn.
<br>
<br>
<b>7. British Seafire Fighter Planes</b><br>
<br>
Requires same Player Enforced and edit use as USA and Japan Navy Fighters listed above.
<br>
<br>
<b>8. German Me-109T Fighter Planes</b><br>
<br>
Requires same Player Enforced and edit use as USA and Japan Navy Fighters listed above.
<br>
<br>
<b>9. Japanese Destroyers</b><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
Triplea will always load Infanty to Destroyer first. Load 1 at a time and use edit if needed.<br>
<br>
Only load with Infantry and Elite infantry. Player Enforced.
<br>
<br>
<b>10. Rockets</b><br>
<br>
Only move 1 space in NCM. Do not take as casualty. Player Enforced. Will auto die if only units left.
<br>
<br>
<b>11. Bidding</b><br>
<br>
Player Enforced. :)
<br>
<br>
<b>12. US Heavy Transport</b><br>
<br>
Player Enforce no more than 2 Tanks per Transport.
<br>
<br>
<b>13. German Type XXI U-boats</b><br>
<br>
Uses a AA shot at attack 4 if no other type of ships attacking for first shot. If no Destroyer present or Destroyer is taken as casualty, you will have option to submerge. If not, you will then fire a normal First Strike Attack and all Defenders will return fire.
<br>
<br>
Take Destroyer as casualty if you plan on submerging after first attack. Battle will then end and you can edit Destroyer back in if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>14. Heavy Bombers</b><br>
<br>
They work correctly. 
<br>
<br>
<b>15. Basic Expansion Rules</b><br>
<br>
Changes to the Basic Expansion Rules. Russian Conscription may only build 12 total now. Germany, Japan, USA, when at war, and UK all recieve 6 PUs for Advanced Production now. Italy receives nothing. 
<br>
<br>
You will need to turn off in Map Options ,or ignore, "Expanded Pacific Ocean", "National Guard" and "Total War".<br>
<br>
Waffen Artillery, Wolfpacks and Landing Craft will show up in the Purchase Window. They should be ignored.<br>
<br>
Basic Expansion Rules are here: https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/assets/uploads/files/1627938181325-rulebook-global-1940-basic-expansion.pdf<br>
<br>
<b>16. 1943 Expansion Rules</b><br>
<br>
1943 Expansion Rules are here: https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/37278/global-1943-house-rules-expansion?page=1<br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
You will need to Edit the Hit Damage to 1 of the Japanese Carriers in Sea Zone 45 and the British Carrier in Sea Zone 106.<br>
<br>
France will also place 4 Infantry regardless of it's Factory damage. Use edit if needed.<br>
<br>
<b>17. Desert Army</b><br>
<br>
Adds the Desert Army Unit. Once the Desert Army is Formed, you will need to edit the correct DesertGeneral. Use "DesertGeneral3" with Tank Units. "DesertGeneral2" with Artillery. Use "DesertGeneralA2D3" for Panzer Grenadier and Armoured Infantry Units. Use "DesertGeneralA1D3" for Combat Engineers. Use"DesertGeneral" for all other Units.<br>
<br>
Move Restrictions are Player Enforced. This may be fixed in the future.
<br>
<br>
Edit in the "tactical_bomberPG/TG" and "artilleryPG/TG" before battle to prevent excessive attack bonus if needed. They will receive no Armour support nor support Infantry Units.<br>
<br>
<b>18. Combat Engineer</b><br>
<br>
Adds the Combat Engineer Unit. Use Edit for moving Minor Factories and removing Landmines. Also for landing at Landing Strips. Land the Air Unit in a legal area and then edit after Non Combat Move. Unit Image courtesy of Hepps.
<br>
<br>
<b>Unofficial SBR Option</b><br>
<br>
This is independent of the Captain and Company's Awesome House Rules, thus "Unofficial". :) 
May be turned on in "Map Options".<br>
Bombers are now a A0 D0 M6 +1 w/AB C5 unit. They may perform SBR attacks only. They have no Air Battle Attack Factor but can be taken as casualties in the Air Battle with Interceptors. They do 1-6 damage. They no longer receive +2 to an SBR attack.<br>
<br>
Fighters now Air battle at Attack 1 on Escort and Defend 2 on Intercept. Tactical Bombers now Air Battle at attack 1.
<br>
<br>
If defending in a Land Combat, do not take as casualty. Player enforced. <br>
If you receive a Notification that says "Units in Following Territories will Die". Ignore this and hit "Done Moving". This will be fixed in the future.<br>
<br>
This has no effect on "Heavy Bombers".<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
<br>
You may manipulate the number of Air battle rounds in "Map Options" before Game Start, as well as, "Attacker" "Defender" retreat.<br>
I suggest using with the default "Expansion" rules, which are unlimited.<br>
<br>
You can also Bomb Underground Factories. Max damage to a Major is 7 and a Minor 2. So the major will be able to produce 3 units at max damage and a minor 1. Heavy Industry has 8 max damage to a major, Minor remains at 2. So 4 and 2 for their minimum builds.<br>
<br>
This represents bombing of transportation lines to the Factories and to encourage more SBR's.<br>
<br>
<b>Unofficial "Normandy Original Owner Pro Neutral Allies"</b><br>
When France is Liberated, Normandy Bordeaux will no longer turn French.<br><br>
<b>Victory Conditions</b><br>
<br>
These are currently Player Enforced. They will be added at a later date. <br>
<br>
<b>18)"Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b><br>
Adds "Charles de Gaulle Neutrals" (Only "Modified" option is available).<br>Discussed in detail here:<b>https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/topic/28180/should-we-make-better-rules-for-invadable-neutrals-1940/4?page=1</b><br><br>
Check the box in "Map Options" before game start. You will need to declare war against the True Neutrals in order to attack them. You will need to <b>Player Enforce</b> correct "Neutral" behavior if needed. <br><br> 
Neutral Ships don’t affect naval at all unless you are attacking them. Neutral Navies are represented with a "Neutral_Navy" <img src="Neutral_Navy.png"/> unit placed in their Home country. You will need to <b>Edit</b> the appropriate number of Ships <b>Before</b> your Combat Move.<br><br>
When attacking a neutral, the units written here are immediately placed in the attacked territory as well as any territories alligned to them (triplea does this automatically). The opposing team will pick a player<b> Player Enforced</b> to represent those forces and collect income from any of their territories you failed to take. So, after combat, use edit to change any surviving units and the territory itself, to the Player of your choice.<br>
<br>
The neutrals which have more than one territory are:<br>
Mongolia (use OOB rules for this one)<br>
Portugal: Portugal, Portuguese Giunea, Angola, Mozambique<br>
Spain: Spain, Rio de Oro<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br>
If Russia attacks Amur or Korea and the Japanese then Declare War on Mongolia, the Mongolian Infantry will immediately turn Russian <b>BUT</b> the Territories will become Pro Allied. <br>
<br>
The new neutral setup is:<br>
<br>
Venezuela: 6 infantry<br>
Colombia: 1 infantry<br>
Ecuador: 1 infantry<br>
Peru: 1 infantry<br>
Bolivia: 1 infantry<br>
Paraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Uraguay: 1 infantry<br>
Argentina: 6 infantry<br>
SZ 66 (alligned with Argentina): 1 cruiser<br>
Chile: 4 infantry<br>
Mozambique: 1 infantry<br>
Angola: 1 infantry<br>
Portugal: 4 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 104 (alligned with Portugal): 1 cruiser, 1 transport<br>
Spain: 10 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 tank, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 92 (alligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
SZ 91 (alligned with Spain): 1 destroyer<br>
Switzerland: 6 infantry<br>
Sweden: 6 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
SZ 114 (alligned with Sweden): 1 destroyer<br>
Turkey: 8 infantry, 1 artillery, 1 AA gun, 1 fighter<br>
SZ 99 (alligned with Turkey): 1 destroyer<br>
Arabia: 6 infantry<br>
Afghanistan: 4 infantry<br><br>

<b>"Charles de Gaulle Neutrals Modified"</b>.<br>
Changes the unit setup for:<br>
Poland: -2 infantry adds 1 fighter<br>
Switzerland: -2 infantry adds 1 artillery, 1 AA gun<br>
Venezuela: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>
Argentina: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>
Chile: -1 infantry adds 1 artillery<br>

<b>Global 1940 Second Edition</b><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b><br>
This game uses the latest Global 1940 2nd Edition (successor to Alpha +3) rules, as posted on Larry's website.<br>
To blitz move mech_infantry with armour, you must click on them both at the same time (use CTRL to create waypoints).<br>
Paratroopers tech enables a second combat movement phase which happens right after the first combat movement phase, and the second one only allowes movement of paratrooping infantry.<br>
<br>

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
The game is not meant to take over your responsibility in knowing the rules. For example, the game engine is not always going to restrict or allow certain attacks. 
It is your responsibility to know the rules and abide by them. Most of the game notes that follow can be thought of as differences compared to WWIIv3 or WWIIv4 rules but obviously are not a complete manual for the game. 
Beginners to these games are suggested to ask for help in the lobby or on the forums at http://www.tripleawarclub.org<br>
You must always validate your own movement, especially air movement at sea.  The engine is not perfect.<br>
<br>

<b>Edit Mode</b><br>
If you ever need to create new UK units, always create "British" units, do not create "UK_Pacific" units (except for Factories and facilities, all UK_Pacific units turn into British units when placed normally).<br>
The Warbonds technology will give the PUs to the British, please use edit mode if you want some of it to go to UK Pacific.<br>
You may also need to use edit mode to correct things listed below.<br>
<br>

<br>Below is a list of rules that the TripleA game engine either does not enforce, or enforces incorrectly, at this point.
<br>Each item starts with a code in parentheses that represents how you may fix or correct the rule.
<br>(PE) = Player Enforced = You must be aware of the rule and must follow it. The engine will not stop you from breaking the rule.
<br>(CL) = Comment Log = You must record what you are doing in the comment log, because TripleA does not keep that information around. (To access the comment log, go to the 'view' menu, and click 'show comment log', then type a comment there.)
<br>(SR) = Save/Reload = You may save the game now or at the start of the phase, then reload it, in order to solve this problem.
<br>(EM) = Edit Mode = You must use Edit Mode to correct or fix the error, because the engine either disallows the rule or otherwise does something wrong that you can correct.
<br>(NA) = None Available = There is no fix available for this yet.
<br>
<br><b>Rules specific to 1940 the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (EM) You may ask for permission during your turn to move through a canal owned by a power you are not yet at war with (use edit mode to move them).
<br>* (CL) TripleA does not keep track of which neutral territories have been previously attacked (use comment log to keep track of this instead).
<br>* (PE) You are not allowed to blitz or move any units through Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You may not land air units in Friendly Neutrals, including the same turn they are captured, unless they have been previously attacked.
<br>* (PE) You can not fly over unfriendly neutrals, unless they are being attacked or they have previously been attacked.
<br>* (PE) Friendly Neutrals can not be 'captured' with an AA Gun, only by land units with an attack power.
<br>* (PE) You may not build facilities on territories that were Dutch at the start of your turn.
<br>* (PE) You may not attack a territory containing units owned by a nation that you are not at war with (even if the territory is owned by someone you are at war with).
<br>* (PE) USA may not end movement in seazone adjacent to Japanese controlled territories when not at war with Japan (Sea Zones 6, 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 33, 34, 36, and 37).
<br>* (EM) Japan can fly over UK and French territories before going to war with them.
<br>* (EM) USA does not have to declare war at the end of USA 3 if they do not want to.
<br>* (PE) You may not conduct an amphibious assault from an allied transport if the defender could scramble and you have no other combat units to protect that transport.
<br>* (EM) If Russia is at war with Italy, but not with Germany, a German warship in sz125 will cancel Russia's national objective (and same if at war with Germany but not Italy, and there is an Italian boat in sz125).
<br>* (EM) If UK Pacific captures Japan, the money should go to UK Pacific, even if UK Pacific's capital is occupied.
<br>* (EM) You must place all units you purchased if you are able to, or as many as you can. Any units not placed get refunded to you (TripleA instead carries them over to the next turn).
<br>* (PE) The victory conditions must be held for a full continuous round after they are achieved (so for example if Italy takes Egypt as the 8th European VC, then the Axis must hold 8 VCs continuously until Italy's next turn).e
<br>* (EM) Rocket damage to an airfield should occur after scrambling, which means if an airbase is disabled by the rocket attack, it could still scramble this turn.
<br>* (PE) Paratroopers (airborne) may not attack multiple territories from a single airbase.
<br>
<br><b>General rules for all A&A games that the engine does not do, but you must follow:</b>
<br>* (PE) Battles should be resolved in this order: all SBR, then all Amphibious Assaults, then all others.
<br>* (SR or EM) Repairing and Purchase are should actually be done at the same time.
<br>* (CL) TripleA does keep track of which units are on which transports, but there is no easy way to see this information when it is not your turn.
<br>* (CL) TripleA should, but does not keep track of which air units are on which carriers.
<br>* (PE) All air moved must have a way of potentially being picked up or landing, and all air that survives combat MUST be picked up if possible.
<br>* (PE) TripleA should not allow non-combat moves to be done during combat move phase.
<br>* (PE) Only non-air units that did not move during combat move and did not participate in combat, may move during non-combat-move.
<br>* (PE) Transports can only be loaded in 1 phase (not both), and unloaded in 1 phase (not both).
<br>* (PE) Transports if unloading for amphibious assault, must unload all their units, and may not hold back some units while offloading other units.
<br>* (NA) Each phase of combat should have all units in that phase fire before any casualty selection occurs, whereas right now in TripleA if air and subs are involved then units might be broken up into smaller groups and casualty selection done for each group.
<br>* (EM) If you select for a bombardment from a sea zone, you should be able to select which units you want to have bombard, but currently all possible units are used.

<b>Political Situation</b><br>
At the start of the game Germany and Italy are at war with the UK and ANZAC and France only, while Japan is at war with China only. Any countries not at war with each other ignore each other's naval units and obviously cannot go into each others ground territories. There are a number of specific politically related rules/conditions for each country:<br><br>

<b>Germany/Italy/Japan</b>
<ul>
<li>Germany/Italy/Japan can declare war on USA or Russia or China at any time.</li>
<li>If Germany/Italy/Japan is at war with one of USA or Russia or China it doesn't affect relations with the other.</li>
<li>While not yet at war with the USA, Japan may not move into sea zones within 2 spaces of Western USA or Alaska.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Russia</b>
<ul>
<li>Russia cannot go to war against the Germans and Italians until the <b>beginning of purchase units phase</b> of Russia 4, unless of course they attack it first, or the Axis capture London.</li>
<li>Russia and Japan may declare war on each other at any time.  When not at war, Russia may not enter China.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>USA</b>
<ul>
<li>If USA is not at war with Germany or Italy, USA may only move its units to sea zones touching USA territories and also Sea Zone 102.</li>
<li>If USA is not at war with Japan, USA may not move its units into sea zones touching Japanese controlled territories.</li>
<li>USA cannot go to war against the Axis until the <b>beginning of PU collect phase</b> of USA 3, unless of course an Axis power attacks it first.</li>
<li>Once at war, the Minor Factories in continental USA upgrade to Major Factories automatically for free, and may be used immediately.</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Neutrals</b><br>
There are three types of neutrals: 
<ul>
<li>pro-Axis: When an Axis unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>pro-Allies: When an Allied unit moves into one of these zones for the first time, that country gets a one-time bonus number of infantry, specified on the map, and control of the territory. The new infantry cannot be moved until the next turn.</li>
<li>Regular: If a power attacks a regular neutral, all the other regular neutrals on the board become friendly to the other team.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Capture of friendly neutrals must be done during Non Combat Movement.<br><br>

When a country moves into a regular or non-friendly neutral during the combat move, it must conduct combat with the number of infantry specified on the map for that neutral. If it loses or retreats, however many infantry that remain are how many that stay in the zone. This means that if Finland was +4 for Axis, and Russia kills 2 infantry and retreats, then Axis only get 2 infantry when they move into Finland.

</ul>
<br><hr><br>


<br><br><hr><br>
<b>Kamikaze Attacks</b><br>
Japan starts the game with 6 attack tokens, and may begin doing Kamikaze Attacks at the start of the game.<br>
These attacks can only be done in sea zones that contain the Kamikaze symbol [the sea zones surrounding: Japan, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, Formosa, and the Marianas].<br>
At the end of Japan's enemy's combat-move phase, Japan may target any surface warship in a Kamikaze zone for one or more Kamikaze attacks, ONLY if the enemy is attacking Japanese units there or is conducting an Amphibious Assault from that sea zone.<br>
For each attack, a die is rolled, and a 2 or less is considered a hit. Casualties are removed immediately, and do not participate in any battles. Kamikaze attacks prevent bombardment as well.<br>
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Submarines Prevent Unescorted Transports From Making Amphibious Assaults</b><br>
In any Sea Zone containing an enemy submarine, but not containing an owned warship, the submarine will prevent the offloading of troops for an amphibious assault. 
<br><br><hr><br>


<b>Scrambling</b><br>
Fighters and/or Tactical bombers can be scrambled from any territory bordering a sea zone, with an operating airfield (less than 3 damage) to help defend the surrounding sea zone using their standard defense values. They cannot retreat from scrambling (defenders can never retreat) and if the territory they were scrambled from is captured, they're given one extra movement point to land on a friendly territory or open carrier. Scrambled air cannot participate in any other battles that round.
<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Strategic Bombing Runs (SBR)</b><br>
Bombing can now happen against both types of ICs, harbours, and airfields (attackers choice)[tactical bombers can not target factories though]. Fighters can participate in the bombing run as escorts. Fighters in the territory being bombed can be launched as interceptors (no airfield necessary).<br><br>
<b>If interceptors are launched:</b> a one-round air battle takes place right away all air involved roll at 1 (jets rolls at 2). Either attacking bombers or fighters can be taken as casualties.<br><br>
After the air battle, or if there were no interceptors, the escorts are retreated and any bombers/tacs remaining can now be divied up to attack specific targets. Each target rolls its built-in AA gun against the bombers/tacs targetting it. If there is an AA gun in the territory being bombed it does <b>not</b> roll because its there to defend combat units and not complexes/bases.
<br><br>

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Blockade Zones</b><br>
If any enemy ships are in a power's blockade zones at the end of that power's turn, and the power controls the adjacent ground territory, then the power may lose some of the PUs it would have otherwise collected.<br>
Surface warships roll 1 dice, Submarines and Air units roll 2 dice, and carriers and transports roll zero dice.  For any roll of 3 or less, that amount of PUs will not be collected by the surrounding land territories.
The power in question cannot lose more PUs from a blockade zones then the worth of the adjacent ground territory to those zones.

<br><br><hr><br>

<b>Placement Restrictions</b>
<ul>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 3 or more, and must be originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes can only go in territories worth 2 or more.</li>
<li>Industrial Complexes can't be built on islands.</li>
<li>Over-purchase is returned and money is reimbursed.</li>
<li>Aircraft can be placed on the ground or on a [new] carrier in the adjacent sea zone that has a spot(s) open.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>

<b>Units</b><br>
These changes to units are things other than price/movement which you can see in the buy menu.
<ul>
<li>Bombers now do 2 additional damage in strategic bombing raids, in addition to their dice roll.</li>
<li>Carriers are two hit.</li>
<li>Minor Industrial Complexes have 3 production capacity. A Minor IC can be upgraded to a Major IC for 20 PUs, but only on originally owned territories.</li>
<li>Major Industrial Complexes have 10 production capacity. When a Major IC is captured it automatically becomes a minor IC.</li>
<li>AA Guns may be taken casualty in combat, and may only fire at up to 3 aircraft each.</li>
</ul>

<b>New Units</b><br>
<b>Tactical Bombers:</b> can land on carriers, can bomb, and if paired with <b>a tank or fighter</b> the Tac attacks at 4. Tactical Bombers can also strategic bomb Airfields and Harbours (but not factories).<br>
<b>Mechanized Infantry:</b> can blitz when paired with a tank, and are supportable by artillery.<br>
<b>Carriers:</b> now have 2 hitpoints, and when damaged they do not allow fighters to land, or to leave if cargo.<br>
<br>
<b>New Buildings</b><br>
<b>Harbour:</b> Any ships that start their turn in a sea zone adjacent to a harbour get +1 movement points. Any damaged ships are repaired by a harbour at the start of the player's purchase and repair turn phase. Lastly, harbours can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the above bonuses.<br>
<b>Airfield:</b> Any air that start their turn on the ground territory with an airfield get +1 movement points. Airfields allow up to 3 planes on that island to scramble (see Scramble section above). Airfields can be bombed, and if they have 3 or more damage then they do not provide the movement bonus.
